#  E-Commerce SQL Database Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and use of a simple **E-Commerce relational database**.  
It is part of my SQL portfolio to showcase skills in schema design, querying, data aggregation, and basic optimization.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Relational schema design & normalization
- SQL querying (SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, CTEs)
- Aggregation & reporting (top products, customer activity)
- Indexing for performance tuning
- Data insertion & management

---

## Database Schema
The database consists of four main tables:

- **Customers**: Stores customer information  
- **Products**: Stores product catalog data  
- **Orders**: Tracks customer orders  
- **Order_Items**: Line items within each order

## Project Files
- **schema.sql** → SQL commands to create the database schema (tables, keys, relationships)  
- **sample_data.sql** → Example INSERT statements to populate the tables with sample data  
- **queries.sql** → Example queries demonstrating analysis, joins, and optimization  
- **ecommerce_db_erd.png** → Visual schema diagram of the database

## Example Queries
- Customers who signed up after Jan 2024  
- Top 5 products by revenue  
- Orders with customer names (JOIN example)  
- Customers with no orders (subquery example)  
- Indexing example for performance

   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd sql-portfolio/ecommerce-db
   ```

3. Run the schema file to create the tables:  
   ```sql

## Future Improvements
- Add `Reviews` table for customer product reviews  
- Create stored procedures for automatic calculations  
- Test query performance with large datasets  
- Connect to visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI)
